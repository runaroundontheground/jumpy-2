# jumpy-2
2D tile based platformer with some parkour. <br>
similar to terraria, but a bit different.
<br><h1>NOTE FOR DEVS</h1> since we're using wick, you can actually change the bg color to clear and save it, and it works, so we don't have to use image editing software to remove the background (yay!)
